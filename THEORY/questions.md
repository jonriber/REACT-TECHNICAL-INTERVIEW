### Answers

- Class components are components built using class syntax. Further more, they all have built in methods called component lifecycle methods, which can modify data according to the current component lifecycle. Class components do have a render method, and uses this keyword to bind custom methods, handlers, local state and props. ItÂ´s necessary to call a class constructor to initialize local state and use props from parent components.<br/>
Functional components are components based in javascript function, which returns something, equivalent to the render method from class components. It doesn't require the use of this keyword anymore and you get a simple and shorter syntax to build components.

- State and props are a type of data. The biggest difference between both of them is that state is data managed locally (inside the component) and props is data received from a parent component, which means, data passed through.

- useEffect is a React hook that allow functional component lifecycle management. It is a conjunction of all other separeted class based components methods, into a single one, so, there you get to modify your components when it has mounted, updated or unmounted.<br/>
A common use case of this hook it to fetch external data (API) into your application, according to an array of dependencies.
